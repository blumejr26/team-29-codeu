    <h2>Joseph Blume</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Summer Feelz: One of the busier times of the year for me; I do a
      lot of traveling all over the country and overseas for work, so I don't
    get to enjoy my summer like most people.  I do enjoy being outside a lot
  more though, New England from the end of Fall through Spring isn't the most
enjoyable time to be outside.  I am looking forward to being on Cape Cod and
Martha's Vineyard a lot the next couple of months though. </p></li>
      <li><p>Aspirational Hobby: I'm a craftsman, so if I had all the time and
      money in the world, it would be building things.  Anything: from this
    little treehouse project I've started for my daughters, to rebuilding this
  '67 Mustang I found the other day in junkyard.</p></li>
      <li><p>Ask me About: My military service.  I always enjoy sharing my stories
      about the Army and I enjoy being a Soldier; I love everyday that I get to
      put on the uniform.</p></li>
